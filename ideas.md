# Menu

This document will be be the blueprint of a menu for the ordering system.

> **Note**
> Edit and build the menu as you see fit. This document will help you to better understand ***HOW*** you want your users interacting with your menu.

## Chinese menu

For example:
Pick one from category 1, one from category 2, or one from either category 3, or 4.
Choose side sauces
etc.

## Deli Style

For example:
Stndard deli sandwich:
  * choose up to 3 kinds of sliced meats (pastrami, turkey, corned beef, etc.)
  * choose one kind of bread (rye, whole wheat, kaiser roll, etc).
  * Choose a style (hot open, hot closed, cold closed, etc.)
  * etc.

## Burger joint

For example:
Burger meal:
  * Choose a patty (beef, lamb, beef/lamb mix, etc.)
  * Choose a cook (med, well done, med-rare, etc.)
  * Choose a roll (plain, whole wheat, gluetn free, etc.)
  * choose a topping (onions, cheese, etc.)
  * etc.

Other menu ideas:
salad bar - build a salad with a base, specialty veg, protiens, etc.

No need to take any the menu ideas above, but they are good ways of showing how objects can get embedded into other objects. Use structures like arrays and others where multi-choices exist.
The idea would be to imagine yourself (close your eyes, or think about it if you take the kids out) and run through the logical groupoings of the menu items.

So far I like what I see. As you go through the building of the backend, try and put together a server architecture document describing what you did, the challenges you faced and how you solved them.
No need for lengthy text here even a quikc breakdown like this will work:
1. Challenge - short techical description
2. Solution - short technical description
3. Whby you chose #3.
